# Smart-Traffic-Light
This is an arduino project to make a prototype of smart traffic light that can detect emergency vehicle so the emergency vehicle can be prioritize. the prototype that we made include 4 junction. this also include laser to detect vehicle to stay behind the zebra cross area.

This project using arduino mega since each traffic light need 4 pin, each laser and laser recevier need 3 pin, and much more so we need a lot of pin for this project. for the detection of the emergency vehicle, we are using qr scanner. so we need to put qr code on the top of emergency vehicle.
